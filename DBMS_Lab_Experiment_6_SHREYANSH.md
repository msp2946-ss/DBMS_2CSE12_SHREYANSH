## ✅ Problem Solutions

### Problem 1: Display Empno, Ename, Deptno with Department Name (Using CASE/DECODE)

**Objective:** Replace department numbers with their corresponding department names using CASE (MySQL/MariaDB equivalent of Oracle's DECODE function).

```sql
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME,
       CASE DEPTNO
           WHEN 10 THEN 'ACCOUNTING'
           WHEN 20 THEN 'RESEARCH'
           WHEN 30 THEN 'SALES'
           WHEN 40 THEN 'OPERATIONS'
       END AS DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

> **Note:** Oracle uses `DECODE(DEPTNO, 10, 'ACCOUNTING', 20, 'RESEARCH', ...)` but MySQL/MariaDB uses the `CASE WHEN` statement as the equivalent.

**Output:**
```
+-------+--------+-----------------+
| EMPNO | ENAME  | DEPARTMENT_NAME |
+-------+--------+-----------------+
|  7369 | SMITH  | RESEARCH        |
|  7499 | ALLEN  | SALES           |
|  7521 | WARD   | SALES           |
|  7566 | JONES  | RESEARCH        |
|  7654 | MARTIN | SALES           |
|  7698 | BLAKE  | SALES           |
|  7782 | CLARK  | RESEARCH        |
|  7788 | SCOTT  | OPERATIONS      |
|  7839 | KING   | RESEARCH        |
|  7844 | TURNER | SALES           |
|  7876 | ADAMS  | RESEARCH        |
|  7900 | JAMES  | SALES           |
|  7902 | FORD   | RESEARCH        |
|  7934 | MILLER | ACCOUNTING      |
+-------+--------+-----------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employees displayed with department names instead of numbers. CASE statement maps: 10→ACCOUNTING, 20→RESEARCH, 30→SALES, 40→OPERATIONS.

---

### Problem 2: Display Your Age in Days

**Objective:** Calculate your age in days using the DATEDIFF() function.

```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), '2005-08-15') AS AGE_IN_DAYS;
```

> **Note:** Replace `'2005-08-15'` with your actual date of birth.

**Output:**
```
+-------------+
| AGE_IN_DAYS |
+-------------+
|        7486 |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Age in days is **7486** days (from August 15, 2005 to February 12, 2026).

---

### Problem 3: Display Your Age in Months

**Objective:** Calculate your age in months using the TIMESTAMPDIFF() function.

```sql
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, '2005-08-15', CURDATE()) AS AGE_IN_MONTHS;
```

> **Note:** Replace `'2005-08-15'` with your actual date of birth.

**Output:**
```
+---------------+
| AGE_IN_MONTHS |
+---------------+
|           245 |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Age in months is **245** months (from August 15, 2005 to February 12, 2026).

---

### Problem 4: Display the Current Date in Formatted Style

**Objective:** Display the current date in the format: **"12th February Thursday 2026"** (equivalent to Oracle's `TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DDth Month Day Year')`).

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%D %M %W %Y') AS FORMATTED_DATE;
```

**Output:**
```
+----------------------------------+
| FORMATTED_DATE                   |
+----------------------------------+
| 12th February Thursday 2026     |
+----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Current date displayed as **"12th February Thursday 2026"** using `DATE_FORMAT()` with `%D` (day with suffix), `%M` (month name), `%W` (weekday name), `%Y` (year).

> **Note:** Oracle equivalent: `SELECT TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DDth Month Day Year') FROM DUAL;` which outputs the year in words (e.g., "Nineteen Ninety-Seven"). MySQL/MariaDB does not natively support year in words.

---

### Problem 5: Display Formatted Joining Details for Each Employee

**Objective:** Display a formatted sentence for each employee showing their joining details.

**Expected Format:** `ENAME has joined the company on DAYNAME Dth MONTHNAME YEAR`

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(ENAME, ' has joined the company on ',
       DAYNAME(HIREDATE), ' ',
       DATE_FORMAT(HIREDATE, '%D'), ' ',
       MONTHNAME(HIREDATE), ' ',
       YEAR(HIREDATE)) AS EMPLOYEE_JOINING
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EMPLOYEE_JOINING                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SMITH has joined the company on Wednesday 17th December 1980          |
| ALLEN has joined the company on Friday 20th February 1981             |
| WARD has joined the company on Sunday 22nd February 1981              |
| JONES has joined the company on Thursday 2nd April 1981               |
| MARTIN has joined the company on Monday 28th September 1981           |
| BLAKE has joined the company on Friday 1st May 1981                   |
| CLARK has joined the company on Tuesday 9th June 1981                 |
| SCOTT has joined the company on Thursday 9th December 1982            |
| KING has joined the company on Tuesday 17th November 1981             |
| TURNER has joined the company on Tuesday 8th September 1981           |
| ADAMS has joined the company on Wednesday 12th January 1983           |
| JAMES has joined the company on Thursday 3rd December 1981            |
| FORD has joined the company on Thursday 3rd December 1981             |
| MILLER has joined the company on Saturday 23rd January 1982           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employees' joining details displayed in a readable sentence format using CONCAT, DAYNAME, DATE_FORMAT, MONTHNAME, and YEAR functions.

---

### Problem 6: Display Specific Employee Joining Detail (SCOTT)

**Objective:** Display Scott's joining information in the formatted sentence style.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(ENAME, ' has joined the company on ',
       DAYNAME(HIREDATE), ' ',
       DATE_FORMAT(HIREDATE, '%D'), ' ',
       MONTHNAME(HIREDATE), ' ',
       YEAR(HIREDATE)) AS EMPLOYEE_JOINING
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME = 'SCOTT';
```

**Output:**
```
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| EMPLOYEE_JOINING                                             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| SCOTT has joined the company on Thursday 9th December 1982   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** SCOTT joined the company on **Thursday, 9th December 1982**.

---

### Problem 7: Find the Date for Nearest Saturday After Current Date

**Objective:** Calculate the next Saturday from today's date.

```sql
SELECT CURDATE() AS TODAY,
       DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),
           INTERVAL MOD(5 - WEEKDAY(CURDATE()) + 7, 7) DAY) AS NEXT_SATURDAY;
```

**Explanation:**
- `WEEKDAY()` returns 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ..., 5=Saturday, 6=Sunday
- Formula `MOD(5 - WEEKDAY(CURDATE()) + 7, 7)` calculates days until next Saturday
- For Thursday (WEEKDAY=3): `MOD(5-3+7, 7)` = `MOD(9,7)` = **2 days**

**Output:**
```
+------------+---------------+
| TODAY      | NEXT_SATURDAY |
+------------+---------------+
| 2026-02-12 | 2026-02-14    |
+------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** The nearest Saturday after February 12, 2026 (Thursday) is **February 14, 2026**.

---

### Problem 8: Display Current Time

**Objective:** Display the current system time.

```sql
SELECT CURTIME() AS CURRENT_TIME;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------------+
| CURRENT_TIME |
+--------------+
| 00:29:00     |
+--------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Current time displayed as **00:29:00** using the `CURTIME()` function.

> **Additional:** You can also use `NOW()` to get both date and time: `SELECT NOW() AS CURRENT_DATETIME;`

---

### Problem 9: Display the Date Three Months Before the Current Date

**Objective:** Calculate and display the date that is 3 months before today.

```sql
SELECT CURDATE() AS TODAY,
       DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH) AS THREE_MONTHS_BEFORE;
```

**Output:**
```
+------------+---------------------+
| TODAY      | THREE_MONTHS_BEFORE |
+------------+---------------------+
| 2026-02-12 | 2025-11-12          |
+------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Three months before February 12, 2026 is **November 12, 2025**.

---

### Problem 10: Display Employees Who Joined in the Month of December

**Objective:** Retrieve employees whose hire date falls in the month of December.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE MONTH(HIREDATE) = 12;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+------------+
| ENAME | HIREDATE   |
+-------+------------+
| SMITH | 1980-12-17 |
| SCOTT | 1982-12-09 |
| JAMES | 1981-12-03 |
| FORD  | 1981-12-03 |
+-------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 4 employees joined in December: SMITH (Dec 1980), SCOTT (Dec 1982), JAMES (Dec 1981), FORD (Dec 1981).

---

### Problem 11: Display First 2 Characters from Hire Date and Last 2 Characters of Salary

**Objective:** Concatenate the first 2 characters of the HIREDATE with the last 2 characters of the salary for each employee.

```sql
SELECT ENAME,
       HIREDATE,
       SAL,
       CONCAT(LEFT(HIREDATE, 2), RIGHT(CAST(SAL AS CHAR), 2)) AS RESULT
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------------+------+--------+
| ENAME  | HIREDATE   | SAL  | RESULT |
+--------+------------+------+--------+
| SMITH  | 1980-12-17 |  800 | 1900   |
| ALLEN  | 1981-02-20 | 1600 | 1900   |
| WARD   | 1981-02-22 | 1250 | 1950   |
| JONES  | 1981-04-02 | 2975 | 1975   |
| MARTIN | 1981-09-28 | 1250 | 1950   |
| BLAKE  | 1981-05-01 | 2850 | 1950   |
| CLARK  | 1981-06-09 | 2450 | 1950   |
| SCOTT  | 1982-12-09 | 3000 | 1900   |
| KING   | 1981-11-17 | 5000 | 1900   |
| TURNER | 1981-09-08 | 1500 | 1900   |
| ADAMS  | 1983-01-12 | 1100 | 1900   |
| JAMES  | 1981-12-03 |  950 | 1950   |
| FORD   | 1981-12-03 | 3000 | 1900   |
| MILLER | 1982-01-23 | 1300 | 1900   |
+--------+------------+------+--------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** First 2 chars of HIREDATE (always '19') concatenated with last 2 chars of SAL displayed for all 14 employees.

---

### Problem 12: Display Employees Whose 10% of Salary Equals the Year of Joining

**Objective:** Find employees where 10% of their salary equals the last two digits of their joining year.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL,
       SAL * 0.10 AS TEN_PERCENT,
       YEAR(HIREDATE) % 100 AS YEAR_LAST2
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE SAL * 0.10 = YEAR(HIREDATE) % 100;
```

**Explanation:** Since full YEAR values (1980-1983) are much larger than 10% of any salary, the comparison uses the last 2 digits of the year.

**Output:**
```
+-------+-----+-------------+------------+
| ENAME | SAL | TEN_PERCENT | YEAR_LAST2 |
+-------+-----+-------------+------------+
| SMITH | 800 |       80.00 |         80 |
+-------+-----+-------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Only **SMITH** qualifies — 10% of 800 = **80**, which matches the year **1980** (last 2 digits = 80).

---

### Problem 13: Display Employees Who Joined Before 15th of the Month

**Objective:** Retrieve employees whose hire day-of-month is less than 15.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, DAY(HIREDATE) AS JOIN_DAY
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DAY(HIREDATE) < 15;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------------+----------+
| ENAME  | HIREDATE   | JOIN_DAY |
+--------+------------+----------+
| JONES  | 1981-04-02 |        2 |
| BLAKE  | 1981-05-01 |        1 |
| CLARK  | 1981-06-09 |        9 |
| SCOTT  | 1982-12-09 |        9 |
| TURNER | 1981-09-08 |        8 |
| ADAMS  | 1983-01-12 |       12 |
| JAMES  | 1981-12-03 |        3 |
| FORD   | 1981-12-03 |        3 |
+--------+------------+----------+
8 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 8 employees joined before the 15th of their respective months.

---

### Problem 14: Display Employees Who Joined Before 15th of the Month

**Objective:** Retrieve employees who joined on a day earlier than the 15th of the month (alternative approach using DATE_FORMAT).

```sql
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(HIREDATE, '%d') < 15;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------------+
| ENAME  | HIREDATE   |
+--------+------------+
| JONES  | 1981-04-02 |
| BLAKE  | 1981-05-01 |
| CLARK  | 1981-06-09 |
| SCOTT  | 1982-12-09 |
| TURNER | 1981-09-08 |
| ADAMS  | 1983-01-12 |
| JAMES  | 1981-12-03 |
| FORD   | 1981-12-03 |
+--------+------------+
8 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Same 8 employees as Problem 13, using `DATE_FORMAT('%d')` as an alternative to `DAY()`.

> **Note:** Both `DAY(HIREDATE)` and `DATE_FORMAT(HIREDATE, '%d')` extract the day of the month. Employees NOT in the list (SMITH-17th, ALLEN-20th, WARD-22nd, MARTIN-28th, KING-17th, MILLER-23rd) joined on or after the 15th.

---

### Problem 15: Display Employees Whose Joining DATE Is Available in DEPTNO

**Objective:** Find employees where the day-of-month from their hire date matches any existing department number.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, DAY(HIREDATE) AS JOIN_DAY, DEPTNO
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DAY(HIREDATE) IN (SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPARTMENT);
```

**Explanation:** DEPARTMENT table has DEPTNO values: 10, 20, 30, 40. We check if the day portion of HIREDATE matches any of these values.

**Output:**
```
+-------+------------+----------+--------+
| ENAME | HIREDATE   | JOIN_DAY | DEPTNO |
+-------+------------+----------+--------+
| ALLEN | 1981-02-20 |       20 |     30 |
+-------+------------+----------+--------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Only **ALLEN** qualifies — joined on the **20th** of February 1981, and **20** is a valid DEPTNO in the DEPARTMENT table. No other employee's hire day matches any DEPTNO (10, 20, 30, 40).
