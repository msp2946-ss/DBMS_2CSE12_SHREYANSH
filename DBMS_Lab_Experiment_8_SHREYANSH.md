### Create SALGRADE Table (if not exists)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SALGRADE (
    GRADE INT,
    LOSAL INT,
    HISAL INT
);

INSERT INTO SALGRADE VALUES (1, 700, 1200);
INSERT INTO SALGRADE VALUES (2, 1201, 1400);
INSERT INTO SALGRADE VALUES (3, 1401, 2000);
INSERT INTO SALGRADE VALUES (4, 2001, 3000);
INSERT INTO SALGRADE VALUES (5, 3001, 9999);
```

### Add LOC Column to DEPARTMENT (if not exists)

```sql
ALTER TABLE DEPARTMENT ADD COLUMN LOC VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE DEPARTMENT SET LOC = 'NEW YORK' WHERE DEPTNO = 10;
UPDATE DEPARTMENT SET LOC = 'DALLAS' WHERE DEPTNO = 20;
UPDATE DEPARTMENT SET LOC = 'CHICAGO' WHERE DEPTNO = 30;
UPDATE DEPARTMENT SET LOC = 'BOSTON' WHERE DEPTNO = 40;
```

## Problem Solutions

### Problem 1: Display All Employees with Their Dept Name

**Objective:** Join EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT tables to show each employee with their department name.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, D.DNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------------+
| ENAME  | DNAME      |
+--------+------------+
| SMITH  | RESEARCH   |
| ALLEN  | SALES      |
| WARD   | SALES      |
| JONES  | RESEARCH   |
| MARTIN | SALES      |
| BLAKE  | SALES      |
| CLARK  | RESEARCH   |
| SCOTT  | OPERATIONS |
| KING   | RESEARCH   |
| TURNER | SALES      |
| ADAMS  | RESEARCH   |
| JAMES  | SALES      |
| FORD   | RESEARCH   |
| MILLER | ACCOUNTING |
+--------+------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

### Problem 2: Display Employees Whose Manager Is JONES, Along with Manager Name

**Objective:** Use a self-join to find employees managed by JONES (EMPNO 7566).

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE_NAME,
       E.JOB,
       M.ENAME AS MANAGER_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO
WHERE M.ENAME = 'JONES';
```

**Output:**
```
+---------------+---------+--------------+
| EMPLOYEE_NAME | JOB     | MANAGER_NAME |
+---------------+---------+--------------+
| SCOTT         | ANALYST | JONES        |

+---------------+---------+--------------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

### Problem 3: Display Employee Details with Job, Dept Name, Manager Name, and Grade — Department Wise

**Objective:** Multi-table join combining EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, SALGRADE, and self-join for manager, ordered by department.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, D.DNAME,
       M.ENAME AS MANAGER,
       S.GRADE
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO

### Problem 4: List Employees (Except Clerks) with Job, Grade, and Dept Name — Sorted by Highest Salary

**Objective:** Exclude CLERKs and display remaining employees with salary grade and department, sorted by salary descending.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL,
       S.GRADE, D.DNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL
WHERE E.JOB != 'CLERK'
ORDER BY E.SAL DESC;
```

### Problem 6: List Employees Who Earn 36000 a Year OR Who Are Not Clerks

**Objective:** Multi-table join with OR condition — annual salary ≥ 36000 OR job is not CLERK.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB,
       E.SAL * 12 AS ANNUAL_SALARY,
       E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, S.GRADE
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL
WHERE E.SAL * 12 >= 36000
   OR E.JOB != 'CLERK';
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+-----------+---------------+--------+------------+-------+
