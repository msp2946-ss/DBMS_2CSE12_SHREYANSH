```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, D.DNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------------+
| ENAME  | DNAME      |
+--------+------------+
| SMITH  | RESEARCH   |
| ALLEN  | SALES      |
| WARD   | SALES      |
| JONES  | RESEARCH   |
| MARTIN | SALES      |
| BLAKE  | SALES      |
| CLARK  | RESEARCH   |
| SCOTT  | OPERATIONS |

| JAMES  | SALES      |
| FORD   | RESEARCH   |
| MILLER | ACCOUNTING |
+--------+------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employees displayed with their department names using INNER JOIN.

---

### Problem 2: Display Employees Whose Manager Is JONES, Along with Manager Name

**Objective:** Use a self-join to find employees managed by JONES (EMPNO 7566).

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE_NAME,
       E.JOB,
       M.ENAME AS MANAGER_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
INNER JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO
WHERE M.ENAME = 'JONES';
```

**Output:**
```
+---------------+---------+--------------+
| EMPLOYEE_NAME | JOB     | MANAGER_NAME |
+---------------+---------+--------------+
| SCOTT         | ANALYST | JONES        |
| FORD          | ANALYST | JONES        |
+---------------+---------+--------------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** **SCOTT** and **FORD** are managed by JONES. Both are ANALYSTs reporting to JONES (EMPNO 7566).

---

### Problem 3: Display Employee Details with Job, Dept Name, Manager Name, and Grade — Department Wise

**Objective:** Multi-table join combining EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, SALGRADE, and self-join for manager, ordered by department.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, D.DNAME,
       M.ENAME AS MANAGER,
       S.GRADE
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO
JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL
ORDER BY D.DNAME;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+-----------+------------+---------+-------+
| ENAME  | JOB       | DNAME      | MANAGER | GRADE |
+--------+-----------+------------+---------+-------+
| MILLER | CLERK     | ACCOUNTING | CLARK   |     2 |
| SCOTT  | ANALYST   | OPERATIONS | JONES   |     4 |
| SMITH  | CLERK     | RESEARCH   | FORD    |     1 |
| JONES  | MANAGER   | RESEARCH   | KING    |     4 |
| CLARK  | MANAGER   | RESEARCH   | KING    |     4 |
| KING   | PRESIDENT | RESEARCH   | NULL    |     5 |
| ADAMS  | CLERK     | RESEARCH   | SCOTT   |     1 |
| FORD   | ANALYST   | RESEARCH   | JONES   |     4 |
| ALLEN  | SALESMAN  | SALES      | BLAKE   |     3 |
| WARD   | SALESMAN  | SALES      | BLAKE   |     2 |
| MARTIN | SALESMAN  | SALES      | BLAKE   |     2 |
| BLAKE  | MANAGER   | SALES      | KING    |     4 |
| TURNER | SALESMAN  | SALES      | BLAKE   |     3 |
| JAMES  | CLERK     | SALES      | BLAKE   |     1 |
+--------+-----------+------------+---------+-------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employees displayed with their job, department, manager, and salary grade ordered by department. KING has NULL manager (PRESIDENT). Grades range from 1 (low salary) to 5 (KING).

---

### Problem 4: List Employees (Except Clerks) with Job, Grade, and Dept Name — Sorted by Highest Salary

**Objective:** Exclude CLERKs and display remaining employees with salary grade and department, sorted by salary descending.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL,
       S.GRADE, D.DNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL
WHERE E.JOB != 'CLERK'
ORDER BY E.SAL DESC;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+-----------+------+-------+------------+
| ENAME  | JOB       | SAL  | GRADE | DNAME      |
+--------+-----------+------+-------+------------+
| KING   | PRESIDENT | 5000 |     5 | RESEARCH   |
| SCOTT  | ANALYST   | 3000 |     4 | OPERATIONS |
| FORD   | ANALYST   | 3000 |     4 | RESEARCH   |
| JONES  | MANAGER   | 2975 |     4 | RESEARCH   |
| BLAKE  | MANAGER   | 2850 |     4 | SALES      |
| CLARK  | MANAGER   | 2450 |     4 | RESEARCH   |
| ALLEN  | SALESMAN  | 1600 |     3 | SALES      |
| TURNER | SALESMAN  | 1500 |     3 | SALES      |
| WARD   | SALESMAN  | 1250 |     2 | SALES      |
| MARTIN | SALESMAN  | 1250 |     2 | SALES      |
+--------+-----------+------+-------+------------+
10 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 10 employees (excluding 4 CLERKs: SMITH, ADAMS, JAMES, MILLER) displayed sorted by salary descending. KING tops with SAL=5000 (Grade 5).

---

### Problem 5: Display Employee Name, Job, and Manager (Including Employees Without Manager)

**Objective:** Use LEFT JOIN to include employees who have no manager (MGR is NULL).

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB,
       M.ENAME AS MANAGER
FROM EMPLOYEE E
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+-----------+---------+
| ENAME  | JOB       | MANAGER |
+--------+-----------+---------+
| SMITH  | CLERK     | FORD    |
| ALLEN  | SALESMAN  | BLAKE   |
| WARD   | SALESMAN  | BLAKE   |
| JONES  | MANAGER   | KING    |
| MARTIN | SALESMAN  | BLAKE   |
| BLAKE  | MANAGER   | KING    |
| CLARK  | MANAGER   | KING    |
| SCOTT  | ANALYST   | JONES   |
| KING   | PRESIDENT | NULL    |
| TURNER | SALESMAN  | BLAKE   |
| ADAMS  | CLERK     | SCOTT   |
| JAMES  | CLERK     | BLAKE   |
| FORD   | ANALYST   | JONES   |
| MILLER | CLERK     | CLARK   |
+--------+-----------+---------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employees displayed. **KING** (PRESIDENT) shows `NULL` as manager because he has no manager (MGR IS NULL). LEFT JOIN ensures KING is included unlike INNER JOIN.

---

### Problem 6: List Employees Who Earn 36000 a Year OR Who Are Not Clerks

**Objective:** Multi-table join with OR condition — annual salary ≥ 36000 OR job is not CLERK.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB,
       E.SAL * 12 AS ANNUAL_SALARY,
       E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, S.GRADE
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL
WHERE E.SAL * 12 >= 36000
   OR E.JOB != 'CLERK';
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+-----------+---------------+--------+------------+-------+
| ENAME  | JOB       | ANNUAL_SALARY | DEPTNO | DNAME      | GRADE |
+--------+-----------+---------------+--------+------------+-------+
| ALLEN  | SALESMAN  |         19200 |     30 | SALES      |     3 |
| WARD   | SALESMAN  |         15000 |     30 | SALES      |     2 |
| JONES  | MANAGER   |         35700 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     4 |
| MARTIN | SALESMAN  |         15000 |     30 | SALES      |     2 |
| BLAKE  | MANAGER   |         34200 |     30 | SALES      |     4 |
| CLARK  | MANAGER   |         29400 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     4 |
| SCOTT  | ANALYST   |         36000 |     40 | OPERATIONS |     4 |
| KING   | PRESIDENT |         60000 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     5 |
| TURNER | SALESMAN  |         18000 |     30 | SALES      |     3 |
| FORD   | ANALYST   |         36000 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     4 |
+--------+-----------+---------------+--------+------------+-------+
10 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 10 employees qualify — all non-CLERKs are included (OR condition). CLERKs (SMITH, ADAMS, JAMES, MILLER) are excluded as they earn less than 36000 annually.

---

### Problem 7: List Employees Who Earn 30000 Per Year AND Are Not Clerks

**Objective:** Multi-table join with AND condition — annual salary ≥ 30000 AND job is not CLERK.

```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB,
       E.SAL * 12 AS ANNUAL_SAL,
       E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, S.GRADE
FROM EMPLOYEE E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL
WHERE E.SAL * 12 >= 30000
  AND E.JOB != 'CLERK';
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+-----------+------------+--------+------------+-------+
| ENAME | JOB       | ANNUAL_SAL | DEPTNO | DNAME      | GRADE |
+-------+-----------+------------+--------+------------+-------+
| JONES | MANAGER   |      35700 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     4 |
| BLAKE | MANAGER   |      34200 |     30 | SALES      |     4 |
| SCOTT | ANALYST   |      36000 |     40 | OPERATIONS |     4 |
| KING  | PRESIDENT |      60000 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     5 |
| FORD  | ANALYST   |      36000 |     20 | RESEARCH   |     4 |
+-------+-----------+------------+--------+------------+-------+
5 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 5 employees earn ≥ 30000 annually AND are not CLERKs. CLARK (SAL=2450, annual=29400) is excluded as 29400 < 30000.

---

### Problem 8: List Employees with Manager's Name and Number — Show 'NO MANAGER' for Those Without

**Objective:** Use LEFT JOIN with IFNULL to display 'NO MANAGER' for employees without a manager.

```sql
SELECT E.EMPNO AS EMP_NO,
       E.ENAME AS EMP_NAME,
       IFNULL(CAST(M.EMPNO AS CHAR), 'N/A') AS MGR_NO,
       IFNULL(M.ENAME, 'NO MANAGER') AS MGR_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEE E
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+----------+--------+------------+
| EMP_NO | EMP_NAME | MGR_NO | MGR_NAME   |
+--------+----------+--------+------------+

|   7782 | CLARK    | 7839   | KING       |
|   7788 | SCOTT    | 7566   | JONES      |
|   7839 | KING     | N/A    | NO MANAGER |
|   7844 | TURNER   | 7698   | BLAKE      |
|   7876 | ADAMS    | 7788   | SCOTT      |
|   7900 | JAMES    | 7698   | BLAKE      |
|   7902 | FORD     | 7566   | JONES      |
|   7934 | MILLER   | 7782   | CLARK      |
+--------+----------+--------+------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employees listed with their managers. **KING** displays `NO MANAGER` and `N/A` for manager number using the `IFNULL()` function.

---

### Problem 9: Select Dept Name, Dept No, and Sum of Salary

**Objective:** Join DEPARTMENT with EMPLOYEE and calculate the total salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT D.DNAME, D.DEPTNO,
       SUM(E.SAL) AS TOTAL_SALARY
FROM DEPARTMENT D

GROUP BY D.DEPTNO, D.DNAME
ORDER BY D.DEPTNO;
```

**Output:**
```
+------------+--------+--------------+

## 🔑 Key SQL Concepts Used

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `INNER JOIN` | Matches rows from both tables | `E JOIN D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO` |
| `LEFT JOIN` | Includes unmatched rows from left table | `E LEFT JOIN M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO` |
| Self-join | Joins table to itself | `EMPLOYEE E JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO` |
| Multi-table JOIN | Joins 3+ tables | `E JOIN D ... JOIN S ...` |
