## ✅ Problem Solutions

### Problem 1: List All Employees and Jobs in Department 30 (Descending Order of Salary)

**Objective:** Retrieve employees from Department 30 sorted by salary in descending order.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, JOB, SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DEPTNO = 30
ORDER BY SAL DESC;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+----------+------+
| ENAME  | JOB      | SAL  |
+--------+----------+------+
| BLAKE  | MANAGER  | 2850 |
| ALLEN  | SALESMAN | 1600 |

| WARD   | SALESMAN | 1250 |
| MARTIN | SALESMAN | 1250 |
| JAMES  | CLERK    |  950 |
+--------+----------+------+
6 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 6 employees in Department 30 sorted by salary (highest first)

---

### Problem 2: Employees Whose Name is 5 Letters, Starts with 'A' and Ends with 'N'

**Objective:** Use pattern matching to find employees with specific name format.

```sql
SELECT JOB, DEPTNO
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE 'A___N';
```

> 📌 **Note:** Each underscore `_` represents exactly one character.

**Output:**
```
+----------+--------+
| JOB      | DEPTNO |
+----------+--------+
| SALESMAN |     30 |
+----------+--------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** ALLEN matches the pattern (A-L-L-E-N = 5 letters)

---

### Problem 3: Display Names of Employees Whose Name Starts with 'S'

**Objective:** Find employees whose name begins with the letter 'S'.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%';
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+
| ENAME |
+-------+
| SMITH |
| SCOTT |
+-------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 2 employees found: SMITH, SCOTT

---

### Problem 4: Display Names of Employees Whose Name Ends with 'S'

**Objective:** Find employees whose name ends with the letter 'S'.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE '%S';
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+
| ENAME |
+-------+
| JONES |
| ADAMS |
| JAMES |
+-------+
3 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 3 employees found: JONES, ADAMS, JAMES

---

### Problem 5: Employees in Department 10/20/40 OR Working as Clerk/Salesman/Analyst

**Objective:** Use compound conditions with `OR` and `IN` operators.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DEPTNO IN (10, 20, 40)
OR JOB IN ('CLERK', 'SALESMAN', 'ANALYST');
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+
| ENAME  |
+--------+
| SMITH  |
| ALLEN  |
| WARD   |
| JONES  |
| MARTIN |
| CLARK  |
| SCOTT  |
| KING   |
| TURNER |
| ADAMS  |
| JAMES  |
| FORD   |
| MILLER |
+--------+
13 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 13 employees match the criteria

---

### Problem 6: Employees Who Earn Commission

**Objective:** Find employees with non-null and positive commission values.

```sql
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL
AND COMM > 0;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+--------+
| EMPNO | ENAME  |
+-------+--------+
|  7499 | ALLEN  |
|  7521 | WARD   |
|  7654 | MARTIN |
+-------+--------+
3 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 3 employees earn commission: ALLEN (300), WARD (300), MARTIN (1400)

---

### Problem 7: Display Employee Number and Total Salary (Salary + Commission)

**Objective:** Calculate total salary including commission using `IFNULL()` function.

```sql
SELECT EMPNO, (SAL + IFNULL(COMM, 0)) AS TOTAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

> 📌 **Note:** `IFNULL(COMM, 0)` returns 0 if COMM is NULL (MySQL/MariaDB).  
> For Oracle, use `NVL(COMM, 0)` instead.

**Output:**
```
+-------+--------------+
| EMPNO | TOTAL_SALARY |
+-------+--------------+
|  7369 |          800 |
|  7499 |         1900 |
|  7521 |         1550 |
|  7566 |         2975 |
|  7654 |         2650 |
|  7698 |         2850 |

|  7902 |         3000 |
|  7934 |         1300 |
+-------+--------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Total salary calculated for all 14 employees

---

### Problem 8: Display Employee Number and Annual Salary

**Objective:** Calculate annual salary (monthly salary × 12).

```sql
SELECT EMPNO, (SAL * 12) AS ANNUAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+---------------+
| EMPNO | ANNUAL_SALARY |
+-------+---------------+
|  7369 |          9600 |
|  7499 |         19200 |

+-------+---------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Annual salary computed for all employees

### Problem 9: Clerks Earning More Than 3000

**Objective:** Find clerks with salary greater than 3000.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE JOB = 'CLERK'
AND SAL > 3000;
```

**Output:**
```
Empty set (0.001 sec)
```

> ⚠️ **Result:** No rows returned. All clerks (SMITH, ADAMS, JAMES, MILLER) have salary ≤ 1300.

---

### Problem 10: Clerks, Salesmen, or Analysts Earning More Than 3000

**Objective:** Find employees in specific jobs earning more than 3000.

```sql
SELECT ENAME

## 🔑 Key SQL Concepts Used

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ORDER BY` | Sort results | `ORDER BY SAL DESC` |
| `ORDER BY DESC` | Sort in descending order | `ORDER BY SAL DESC` |
| `LIKE` with `%` | Match any characters | `LIKE 'S%'` |
| `LIKE` with `_` | Match single character | `LIKE 'A___N'` |
| `IS NOT NULL` | Check for non-null values | `WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL` |
| `IFNULL()` | Replace NULL with value | `IFNULL(COMM, 0)` |
| Arithmetic | Calculated columns | `SAL * 12`, `SAL + COMM` |
| Alias (`AS`) | Rename column in output | `AS TOTAL_SALARY` |

---

## 📚 Pattern Matching Reference

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `'S%'` | Starts with 'S' | SMITH, SCOTT |
| `'%S'` | Ends with 'S' | JONES, ADAMS, JAMES |
| `'%AR%'` | Contains 'AR' | WARD, MARTIN, CLARK |
| `'A___N'` | 5 chars: A + 3 any + N | ALLEN |
| `'_____'` | Exactly 5 characters | SMITH, JONES, etc. |

---

## 🔄 NULL Handling Functions

| Database | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| MySQL/MariaDB | `IFNULL(col, value)` | `IFNULL(COMM, 0)` |
| Oracle | `NVL(col, value)` | `NVL(COMM, 0)` |
| SQL Server | `ISNULL(col, value)` | `ISNULL(COMM, 0)` |
| PostgreSQL | `COALESCE(col, value)` | `COALESCE(COMM, 0)` |
