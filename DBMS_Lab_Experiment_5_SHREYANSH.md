---

### Problem 13: Display the Names of the Employee in Proper Case

**Objective:** Show all employee names in proper case (first letter uppercase, rest lowercase). MariaDB/MySQL does not have a built-in INITCAP function, so we use CONCAT + UPPER + LOWER + SUBSTRING.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(ENAME, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(ENAME, 2))) AS EMPLOYEE_NAME_PROPER
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**

| Allen                |
| Ward                 |
| Jones                |
| Martin               |
| Blake                |
| Clark                |
| Scott                |
| King                 |
| Turner               |
| Adams                |
| James                |
| Ford                 |
| Miller               |
+----------------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employee names displayed in proper case (title case) using CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, and SUBSTRING functions.

---

### Problem 14: Display the Length of Your Name Using Appropriate Function

**Objective:** Use the LENGTH() function to find the length of your name.

```sql
SELECT LENGTH('shreyansh pratap mishra') AS NAME_LENGTH;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------------+
| NAME_LENGTH |
+-------------+
|          10 |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** The length of the name **"shreyansh pratap mishra"** is **10** characters (including the space).

---

### Problem 15: Display the Length of All the Employee Names

**Objective:** Show the name and its length for all employees using the LENGTH() function.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, LENGTH(ENAME) AS NAME_LENGTH
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+-------------+
| ENAME  | NAME_LENGTH |
+--------+-------------+
| SMITH  |           5 |
| ALLEN  |           5 |
| WARD   |           4 |
| JONES  |           5 |
| MARTIN |           6 |
| BLAKE  |           5 |
| CLARK  |           5 |
| SCOTT  |           5 |
| KING   |           4 |
| TURNER |           6 |
| ADAMS  |           5 |
| JAMES  |           5 |
| FORD   |           4 |
| MILLER |           6 |
+--------+-------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employee name lengths displayed. Shortest names are WARD, KING, FORD (4 chars); longest are MARTIN, TURNER, MILLER (6 chars).
