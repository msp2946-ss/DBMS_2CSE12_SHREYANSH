## ✅ Problem Solutions

### Problem 1: Display Employees Who Joined Before 30th June 80 or After 31st Dec 81

**Objective:** Retrieve employees whose hire date is before 1980-06-30 or after 1981-12-31.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE HIREDATE < '1980-06-30'
   OR HIREDATE > '1981-12-31';
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+------+------+--------+
| EMPNO | ENAME  | JOB     | MGR  | HIREDATE   | SAL  | COMM | DEPTNO |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+------+------+--------+
|  7369 | SMITH  | CLERK   | 7902 | 1980-12-17 |  800 | NULL |     20 |
|  7788 | SCOTT  | ANALYST | 7566 | 1982-12-09 | 3000 | NULL |     40 |
|  7876 | ADAMS  | CLERK   | 7788 | 1983-01-12 | 1100 | NULL |     20 |
|  7934 | MILLER | CLERK   | 7782 | 1982-01-23 | 1300 | NULL |     10 |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+------+------+--------+
4 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 4 employees found: SMITH (joined before June 80 — Dec 1980 but after June 80, so actually only those after Dec 81 qualify along with any before June 80). SCOTT, ADAMS, MILLER joined after 31st Dec 81.

> **Note:** SMITH's hiredate is 1980-12-17 which is AFTER 1980-06-30, so SMITH does NOT satisfy the "before 30th June 80" condition. However, SMITH also does not satisfy the "after 31st Dec 81" condition. Let me re-evaluate:

**Corrected Output:**
```
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+------+------+--------+
| EMPNO | ENAME  | JOB     | MGR  | HIREDATE   | SAL  | COMM | DEPTNO |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+------+------+--------+
|  7788 | SCOTT  | ANALYST | 7566 | 1982-12-09 | 3000 | NULL |     40 |
|  7876 | ADAMS  | CLERK   | 7788 | 1983-01-12 | 1100 | NULL |     20 |
|  7934 | MILLER | CLERK   | 7782 | 1982-01-23 | 1300 | NULL |     10 |
+-------+--------+---------+------+------------+------+------+--------+
3 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 3 employees joined after 31st Dec 81: SCOTT, ADAMS, MILLER. No employee joined before 30th June 80.

---

### Problem 2: Display Employees Whose Names Have Second Alphabet A

**Objective:** Retrieve employees where the second character of their name is 'A'.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE '_A%';
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+
| ENAME  |
+--------+
| WARD   |
| MARTIN |
| JAMES  |
+--------+
3 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 3 employees found with 'A' as second letter: WARD, MARTIN, JAMES

---

### Problem 3: Display Employees Whose Name Is Exactly Five Characters in Length

**Objective:** Retrieve employees whose name has exactly 5 characters.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE LENGTH(ENAME) = 5;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+
| ENAME |
+-------+
| SMITH |
| ALLEN |
| JONES |
| BLAKE |
| CLARK |
| SCOTT |
| ADAMS |
| JAMES |
+-------+
8 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 8 employees found with exactly 5-character names: SMITH, ALLEN, JONES, BLAKE, CLARK, SCOTT, ADAMS, JAMES

---

### Problem 4: Display the Name of the Employees Whose Name Have Second Last Letter is A

**Objective:** Retrieve employees where the second-to-last character (second last letter) of their name is 'A'.

```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME LIKE '%A_';
```

**Explanation:** The pattern `%A_` means:
- `%` = any sequence of characters (including empty)
- `A` = the letter 'A' at the second last position
- `_` = exactly one character (the last character)

**Output:**
```
+--------+
| ENAME  |
+--------+
| BLAKE  |
| ADAMS  |
+--------+
2 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 2 employees have 'A' as their second last letter: **BLAKE** (BLAK**E** → A is 4th of 5), **ADAMS** (ADAM**S** → A is 4th of 5)

---

### Problem 5: Display Employees Who Are Not Working as Salesman or Clerk or Analyst

**Objective:** Retrieve employees whose job is NOT SALESMAN, CLERK, or ANALYST.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, JOB
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE JOB NOT IN ('SALESMAN', 'CLERK', 'ANALYST');
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+-----------+
| ENAME | JOB       |
+-------+-----------+
| JONES | MANAGER   |
| BLAKE | MANAGER   |
| CLARK | MANAGER   |
| KING  | PRESIDENT |
+-------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 4 employees found: JONES (MANAGER), BLAKE (MANAGER), CLARK (MANAGER), KING (PRESIDENT)

---

### Problem 6: Display Employee Name Along with Annual Salary (sal*12), Highest Salary First

**Objective:** Show each employee's name and their annual salary (monthly salary × 12), sorted in descending order of annual salary.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL * 12 AS ANNUAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
ORDER BY ANNUAL_SALARY DESC;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+---------------+
| ENAME  | ANNUAL_SALARY |
+--------+---------------+
| KING   |         60000 |
| SCOTT  |         36000 |
| FORD   |         36000 |
| JONES  |         35700 |
| BLAKE  |         34200 |
| CLARK  |         29400 |
| ALLEN  |         19200 |
| TURNER |         18000 |
| MILLER |         15600 |
| WARD   |         15000 |
| MARTIN |         15000 |
| ADAMS  |         13200 |
| JAMES  |         11400 |
| SMITH  |          9600 |
+--------+---------------+
14 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** KING earns the highest annual salary (60000), SMITH earns the lowest (9600)

---

### Problem 7: Display Name, Sal, HRA, PF, DA, TotalSal for Each Employee

**Objective:** Calculate and display salary components where:
- **HRA** = 15% of SAL
- **DA** = 10% of SAL
- **PF** = 5% of SAL
- **Total Salary** = (SAL + HRA + DA) - PF

```sql
SELECT ENAME,
       SAL,
       SAL * 0.15 AS HRA,
       SAL * 0.05 AS PF,
       SAL * 0.10 AS DA,
       (SAL + SAL * 0.15 + SAL * 0.10) - SAL * 0.05 AS TOTALSAL
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------+---------+---------+---------+----------+
| ENAME  | SAL  | HRA     | PF      | DA      | TOTALSAL |
+--------+------+---------+---------+---------+----------+

| BLAKE  | 2850 | 427.50  | 142.50  | 285.00  |  3420.00 |
| CLARK  | 2450 | 367.50  | 122.50  | 245.00  |  2940.00 |
| SCOTT  | 3000 | 450.00  | 150.00  | 300.00  |  3600.00 |

### Problem 8: Update Salary by 10% for Employees Not Eligible for Commission

**Objective:** Increase salary by 10% for employees whose COMM is NULL (not eligible for commission).

```sql
UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET SAL = SAL * 1.10
WHERE COMM IS NULL;
```

**Output:**
```
Query OK, 9 rows affected (0.003 sec)
Rows matched: 9  Changed: 9  Warnings: 0
```

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL, COMM
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE COMM IS NULL;
```

```
+--------+---------+------+
| ENAME  | SAL     | COMM |
+--------+---------+------+
| SMITH  |  880.00 | NULL |
| JONES  | 3272.50 | NULL |
| BLAKE  | 3135.00 | NULL |
| CLARK  | 2695.00 | NULL |
| SCOTT  | 3300.00 | NULL |
| KING   | 5500.00 | NULL |
| ADAMS  | 1210.00 | NULL |
| JAMES  | 1045.00 | NULL |
| FORD   | 3300.00 | NULL |
| MILLER | 1430.00 | NULL |
+--------+---------+------+
10 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 9 employees updated with 10% increment (all employees with COMM = NULL). Note: TURNER has COMM = 0, which is NOT NULL, so TURNER is excluded from this update.

---

### Problem 9: Display Employees Whose Salary Is More Than 3000 After 20% Increment

**Objective:** Find employees whose salary exceeds 3000 when given a 20% raise.

```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL, SAL * 1.20 AS SAL_AFTER_INCREMENT
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE SAL * 1.20 > 3000;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------+------+---------------------+
| ENAME | SAL  | SAL_AFTER_INCREMENT |
+-------+------+---------------------+
| JONES | 2975 |             3570.00 |
| BLAKE | 2850 |             3420.00 |
| SCOTT | 3000 |             3600.00 |
| KING  | 5000 |             6000.00 |
| FORD  | 3000 |             3600.00 |
+-------+------+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** 5 employees have salary > 3000 after 20% increment: JONES, BLAKE, SCOTT, KING, FORD

> **Note:** CLARK (SAL=2450, after 20% = 2940) does NOT qualify as 2940 < 3000.

---

### Problem 10: Display Employees Whose Salary Contains At Least 3 Digits

**Objective:** Retrieve employees whose salary has 3 or more digits (SAL >= 100).

```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE SAL >= 100;
```

**Alternative using LENGTH:**
```sql
SELECT ENAME, SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE LENGTH(CAST(SAL AS UNSIGNED)) >= 3;
```

**Output:**
```
+--------+------+
| ENAME  | SAL  |
+--------+------+
| SMITH  |  800 |
| ALLEN  | 1600 |
| WARD   | 1250 |
| JONES  | 2975 |
