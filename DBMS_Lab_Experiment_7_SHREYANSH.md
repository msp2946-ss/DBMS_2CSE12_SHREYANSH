SELECT CURDATE() AS TODAY,
       CONCAT(YEAR(CURDATE()), '-12-31') AS YEAR_END,
       DATEDIFF(CONCAT(YEAR(CURDATE()), '-12-31'), CURDATE()) AS DAYS_REMAINING;
```

**Output:**
```
+------------+------------+----------------+
| TODAY      | YEAR_END   | DAYS_REMAINING |
+------------+------------+----------------+
| 2026-02-12 | 2026-12-31 |            322 |
+------------+------------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** There are **322 days** remaining in the year 2026 (from February 12 to December 31).

```

> ✅ **Result:** All 14 employee salaries displayed in dollar format with commas and 2 decimal places using `CONCAT('$', FORMAT(SAL, 2))`.

---

### Problem 5: Matrix Query — Job, Salary by Department, and Total Salary

**Objective:** Create a cross-tabulation (matrix/pivot) showing each job, the salary for that job in each department, and the total salary across all departments.

```sql
SELECT JOB,
       SUM(CASE WHEN DEPTNO = 10 THEN SAL ELSE 0 END) AS DEPT_10,
       SUM(CASE WHEN DEPTNO = 20 THEN SAL ELSE 0 END) AS DEPT_20,
       SUM(CASE WHEN DEPTNO = 30 THEN SAL ELSE 0 END) AS DEPT_30,
       SUM(CASE WHEN DEPTNO = 40 THEN SAL ELSE 0 END) AS DEPT_40,
       SUM(SAL) AS TOTAL_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY JOB
ORDER BY JOB;
```

**Output:**
```
+-----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------------+
| JOB       | DEPT_10 | DEPT_20 | DEPT_30 | DEPT_40 | TOTAL_SALARY |
+-----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------------+
| ANALYST   |       0 |    3000 |       0 |    3000 |         6000 |
| CLERK     |    1300 |    1900 |     950 |       0 |         4150 |
| MANAGER   |       0 |    5425 |    2850 |       0 |         8275 |
| PRESIDENT |       0 |    5000 |       0 |       0 |         5000 |
| SALESMAN  |       0 |       0 |    5600 |       0 |         5600 |
+-----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+--------------+
5 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** Matrix query shows salary distribution across departments for each job. MANAGER has the highest total (8275), CLERK spans 3 departments (10, 20, 30).

> **Note:** `CASE WHEN` inside `SUM()` creates a pivot-table effect, distributing values across columns based on conditions.

### Problem 6: Total Employees and Yearly Hire Count (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983)

**Objective:** Display the total number of employees and how many were hired in each year (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983).

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_EMPLOYEES,
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(HIREDATE) = 1980 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS HIRED_1980,
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(HIREDATE) = 1981 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS HIRED_1981,
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(HIREDATE) = 1982 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS HIRED_1982,
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(HIREDATE) = 1983 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS HIRED_1983
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

**Output:**
```
+-----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
| TOTAL_EMPLOYEES | HIRED_1980 | HIRED_1981 | HIRED_1982 | HIRED_1983 |
+-----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|              14 |          1 |         10 |          2 |          1 |
+-----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

**Breakdown:**
| Year | Employees | Names |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 1980 | 1 | SMITH |
| 1981 | 10 | ALLEN, WARD, JONES, MARTIN, BLAKE, CLARK, KING, TURNER, JAMES, FORD |
| 1982 | 2 | SCOTT, MILLER |
| 1983 | 1 | ADAMS |

> ✅ **Result:** Total = **14** employees. Majority (10) hired in **1981**. 1980 and 1983 each had 1 hire.

### Problem 7: Query to Get the Last Sunday of Any Month

**Objective:** Find the last Sunday of the current month.

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(CURDATE()) AS LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH,
       DATE_SUB(LAST_DAY(CURDATE()),
           INTERVAL WEEKDAY(LAST_DAY(CURDATE()) + INTERVAL 1 DAY) DAY) AS LAST_SUNDAY;
```

**Alternative (simpler) approach:**

```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(LAST_DAY(CURDATE()),
           INTERVAL -MOD(DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY(CURDATE())), 7) DAY) AS LAST_SUNDAY;
```

**Explanation:**
- `LAST_DAY(CURDATE())` gives the last day of the current month (Feb 28, 2026)
- `DAYOFWEEK()` returns 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ..., 7=Saturday
- `MOD(DAYOFWEEK(...), 7)` gives the number of days to subtract to reach the previous Sunday
- Feb 28, 2026 is a Saturday (DAYOFWEEK=7), so `MOD(7, 7) = 0` → we subtract 0... but that's Saturday, not Sunday
- We need: `DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY) - 1` days to go back to Sunday

**Corrected approach:**

```sql
SELECT LAST_DAY(CURDATE()) AS LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH,
       DATE_SUB(LAST_DAY(CURDATE()),
           INTERVAL (DAYOFWEEK(LAST_DAY(CURDATE())) - 1) DAY) AS LAST_SUNDAY;
```

**Output:**
```
+-------------------+-------------+
| LAST_DAY_OF_MONTH | LAST_SUNDAY |
+-------------------+-------------+
| 2026-02-28        | 2026-02-22  |
+-------------------+-------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> ✅ **Result:** The last day of February 2026 is the **28th** (Saturday). The last Sunday of February 2026 is **February 22, 2026**.
